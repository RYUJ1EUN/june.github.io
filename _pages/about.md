Hi, I’m Ji-eun Ryu.
Please call me <strong style="color: #B000B0;">June.</strong>
I am a Ph.D. student specializing in 
<strong style="color: #B000B0;">Mathematics</strong> and 
<strong style="color: #B000B0;">Cryptography</strong>. 
My research focus includes:

* **RNG** (Random Number Generation)
* **PQC** (Post-Quantum Cryptography)
* **White-box Encryption**
* Quantum Computing 

I share on this site to document my work and what I’ve learned. 
Currently, I’m delving into <strong style="color: #B000B0;">RNG</strong> 
and <strong style="color: #B000B0;">White-box Encryption</strong>, 
and I hope this site helps me stay accountable.

Since my main goal is to track my learning journey, 
you’ll find a wide range of content here— from in-depth technical documentation 
to very basic TIL. I’m still getting used to managing this blog, 
so the categories might seem a bit disorganized or messy at times🙈!


<br>
<br>

I wish for a life full of Books, Exhibitions and Jazz.
When I’m not diving into research, you can usually find me 
<strong style="color: #B000B0;">reading</strong> or visiting 
<strong style="color: #B000B0;">art exhibitions</strong>.
I believe that everything I experience helps me grow, so I try to experience 
as much as possible, whether directly or indirectly. I hope this corner of 
the internet offers you new experiences and inspiration.
