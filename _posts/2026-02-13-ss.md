This technique enables the construction of robust key management schemes for cryptographic systems that can function securely and reliably even when misfortunes destroy half the pieces and security breaches expose all but one of the remaining pieces.

1. knowledge of any $k$ or more $D_i$ pieces makes $D$ easily computable;

2. knowledge of any $k-1$ or fewer $D_i$ pieces leaves $D$ completely undetermined (in the sense that all its possible values are equally likely)

By using a $(k,n)$ threshold scheme with $n=2k-1$ we get a very robust key management scheme:

our opponents cannot reconstruct the key even when security breaches expose $\lfloor n/2 \rfloor = k-1$ of the remaining $k$ pieces.

Our scheme is based on polynomial interpolation:

Knowledge of just $k-1$ of these values, on the other hand, does not suffice in order to calculate $D$.

Let us now assume that $k-1$ of these $n$ pieces are 
revealed to an opponent. For each candidate value $D'$ in 
$[0, p)$ he can construct one and only one polynomial 
$q'(x)$ of degree $k- 1$ such that $q'(0) =D'$ and $q'(i) =D_i$ 
for the $k- 1$ given arguments. By construction, these $p$ 
possible polynomials are equally likely, and thus there is 
absolutely nothing the opponent can deduce about the 
real value of $D$. 

the smallest usable value of $p$ is $n + 1$ (there must be at least $n + 1$ distinct arguments in $[0, p)$ to evaluate $q(x)$ at).
